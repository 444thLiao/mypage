I am a PhD student major in biology. My work covers implementations of new bioinformatic methods to study early life evolution and machine learning-aided traits prediction. I primarily work on i) developing novel strategies and pipeline methods for molecular clock analysis, and ii) developing machine learning techniques and implementing a robust framework for predicting phenotypic changes of microbes. Besides, I am interested in resolving complex and entangled relationships between the evolution of organisms and geochemical contexts that were likely to have interacted.

This website will be used as an summary for my work and my ideas.
