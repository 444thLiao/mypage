My wife, a talented postdoctoral researcher in structural biology, has extensive hands-on experience in purifying submitochondrial particles (SMPs) from ovine heart mitochondria using differential centrifugation [ISTA](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/sazanov-group/). She has further applied cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the structural organization of the complete mitochondrial respiratory complexes within these SMPs.

During her PhD, her research focused on elucidating the structure and function of algal photosynthetic membrane proteins, integrating approaches from biochemistry, bioinformatics, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular biology. Throughout her undergraduate and graduate studies, she examined the physiological and biochemical responses of plants under abiotic stress, explored the molecular basis of plant adaptation to adverse environments, and contributed to the systematic taxonomy of plants.

Her major research contributions include:

Using cryo-EM, biochemistry, and molecular biology to decipher the structure of the photosystem I light-harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) in Symbiodinium and Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L.

Applying transcriptomics to investigate the compensatory mechanisms of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under short-term salt stress and the regulatory strategies employed by the salt-tolerant plant Atriplex centralasiatica to adapt to saline conditions.
